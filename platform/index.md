# MissionSquad Platform (Cloud or Customer‑Hosted UI)

This section documents the MissionSquad Platform UI. It covers dashboard navigation, managing providers/models/agents, vector stores and files, usage metrics, and workspace settings. The Platform can be deployed as:
- Cloud‑hosted by MissionSquad
- Customer‑hosted (self‑managed) UI

The detailed guides below will be filled in next.

## What You Can Do in the Platform

- Providers
  - Connect and manage upstream AI providers (keys/URLs masked in UI and APIs)
- Models
  - Discover provider models and add them to your workspace (chat and embeddings)
- Agents
  - Create named agents, configure prompts, link underlying models, and manage options
- Vector Stores
  - Create stores, manage chunking strategies, embed files, cancel embedding sessions
- Files
  - Upload, view metadata, remove, and associate files with vector stores
- Tools & Servers
  - Inspect available tools and MCP servers (where applicable)
- Usage & Diagnostics
  - Review high‑level health, diagnostics, and usage information
- Workspace Settings
  - Configure keys, base URLs, organization/project settings (as applicable)

## Deployment Modes

- Cloud‑hosted
  - Managed by MissionSquad, minimal setup
- Customer‑hosted
  - Self‑deployed in your environment; integrates with your security and networking controls

## Navigation Overview (Coming Soon)

- Dashboard
- Providers
- Models
